# Answers:

## Question 1: How often do you go to Munchie Mart?
- once every couple days
- I go to munchie mart about 3 or 4 times a week
- almost every day

## Question 2: Do you have a preferred Munchie Mart? Why?
- the Towers munchie mart. It is closer to where I live, so it's most convenient when I don't want to leave to eat something
- My preferred munchie mart is the Towers one because it is in my own dorm.
- I prefer commons or Morgan, because they’re the ones in closest proximity that are also most accessible for gluten free people

## Question 3: Do you know all Munchie Mart hours/timings?
- Unfortunately no, but I would like to!
- I know that the only 24 hour munchie marts are Branscomb and Commons, but I do not know the specifics of the other ones
- Most, but not all.

## Question 4: Would you like to know who is working at a Munchie Mart before you go?
- No, that doesn't really matter to me.
- That is not something that I care about
- Not really, but there are some people I prefer to interact with more than others—it just wont prevent me from going

## Question 5: Do you know what each Munchie Mart carries?
- I have some sort of idea, but I don't know everything for each one. I've got a pretty good idea of what the Towers munchie has.
- The only differences I notice are the restaurants like rocket subs. I don't know any other differences.
- Most of them, except not the ones in Towers and Kissam

## Question 6: Do you ever choose to go to a specific Munchie Mart because of what they carry?
- No, location matters most for me
- I go to towers munchie because of rocket subs, but also just for convenience.
- Absolutely. Much of the time.

## Question 7: How often, if ever, do you go to a Munchie Mart for a specific item? 
- Pretty often. I'm generally looking for a specific frozen food.
- I often go to munchie with what I want already decided on before I get there.
- A couple times a week for both.

## Question 8: How often is something you go to Munchie Mart for specifically out of stock? How often is something you go to Munchie Mart for not carried by it?
- It's usually pretty well stocked for the items they have.
- There is a spicy snack pack in the potato chip section that is often out of stock.
- Every week for both.

## Question 9: What are some items that Munchie Marts don’t carry that they should?
- Amy's Meatless Spaghetti and Meatballs as well as Gushers which they stopped carrying a year ago.
- I don't know. I don't have anything that I really want.
- More fresh food and more gluten free food- it’s happened in the past, but there’s no consistency

## Question 10: What are changes you would like to see with Munchie Mart?
- I want Munchie Marts to carry what I want, like the items they stopped carrying.
- Having each munchie mart have its own "restaurant" would be nice, and I am disappointed that rotiki was taken away from the Bransomb Munchie.
- More consistent stocking of allergen-free foods. There are some things that aren’t specifically gluten-free, or vegetarian, or dairy-free that are never out of stock but when the allergen ones go out of stock you just have to hope they’ll refill it soon. Also more fresh produce options would be nice.

## Question 11: Would you like to be able to know what is in a Munchie Mart before you go?
- Absolutely! That would be so helpful!
- I guess, but it is not that important to me.
- Absolutely! That would be nice.
